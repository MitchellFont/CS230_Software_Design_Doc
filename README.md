-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  Our client for this software design document was The Gaming Room. They had an existing drawing application for Android smartphones. They were looking for help in developing it into a web-based game to be used across a variety of platforms. This was to be a browser game and it was going to use a repository of images and render them slowly (30 seconds) allowing people to guess what it was as the image became more clear.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

   I believe I did the evaluation particularly well in this document. I went through each of the operating systems and the different cloud environments. I also went into great detail on the programming environments on each of those operating systems and whether the popular choices were cross-compatible with other operating systems. I think I gave a rather extensive breakdown of what each operating system would lead the user or developer to expect with the system.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  A design document helped create the definitions and traceability matrix for the developers. This seems to be one of our first documents where we talk about the needs of the clients, and give everyone on the project an idea of what it will take to develop it.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would have gone back and just created one iteration of the document by correctly revising each section and adding to the version number. I would also adapt my design constraints with that solid end goal in mind.
  
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  Many of the user's needs were incorporated into the design constraints section. There, I discussed security, storage, memory, and functional requirements like teams and multiplayer. It is important to consider the needs of the user throughout the design document because they are the ones the system is ultimately being designed to for, and if they stop playing the game the companies revenue will decrease.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I would work to develop a behavioral and functional model of the software. We could use UML design tools like LucidChart to draw this out and communicate these ideas to other project managers and developers to get feedback no matter what the software application would be. These tools are created with the feedback received from the client, just as we have worked with in this class.
